# Planck's Constant Determination Using LEDs

This project demonstrates an experiment to determine **Planck's constant** using LEDs. It utilizes the relationship between the energy of photons emitted by LEDs and their respective wavelengths. The project includes a web-based interface for data collection, graph plotting, and PDF export of the results.

## Features

- **Interactive Experiment Interface**:
  - Enter observation data for LED voltages and wavelengths.
  - Automatically plot the graph of `Energy (E)` vs `Frequency (F)`.

- **Graphical Analysis**:
  - Calculate Planck's constant using the slope of the graph.
  - Real-time graph plotting using `canvas`.

- **PDF Export**:
  - Generate a professional report with observation table, graph, and modal details.
  - Export results in a single PDF file for further analysis.
